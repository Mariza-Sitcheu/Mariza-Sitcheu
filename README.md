Welcome to My GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! Iâ€™m Mariza a newcomer to GitHub and a passionate explorer in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. While I may be just starting my journey here, my curiosity and drive to learn have no limits. Iâ€™m eager to build projects, dive into data, and explore the exciting potential of AI.
ðŸŒ± A Journey of Learning

I recently began my journey with Git and GitHub, and I'm excited to turn this space into a hub for my learning and growth. Right now, Iâ€™m focused on:

    Building a solid foundation in data science and AI: Exploring fundamental concepts, tools, and techniques.
    Taking on challenges and building projects: Even if theyâ€™re small, each project will be a step forward!
    Experimenting and learning from others: Iâ€™m eager to follow projects, learn from the community, and gain insights that push my skills further.

ðŸš€ Always Ready for New Challenges

I believe that learning is a continuous adventure, and Iâ€™m here for the journey! Iâ€™m motivated to:

    Keep learning new skills: Whether itâ€™s machine learning algorithms, data analysis tools, or coding best practices, Iâ€™m always up for expanding my knowledge.
    Take on challenges: As my skills grow, Iâ€™m excited to tackle new problems and build solutions that make an impact.
    Connect and collaborate: Iâ€™m looking forward to connecting with other learners and creators in the community. Letâ€™s inspire and motivate each other!

ðŸ”— Let's Connect!
